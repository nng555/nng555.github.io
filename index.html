  <p id="aboutme">
  I'm a fifth year PhD student at the University of Toronto visiting at MIT advised by <a href="https://healthyml.org">Marzyeh Ghassemi</a>. 
  My general research interest is in developing methods to learn efficient and robust representations of discrete-valued sequence data (specifically natural language). 
  Iâ€™m also interested in understanding and finding ways to fix their pathologies once trained. 
  My research broadly covers topics in representation learning, interpretability, and out-of-domain robustness/generalization.
