  <p id="aboutme">
  I am a fourth year PhD student at the University of Toronto visiting at MIT advised by <a href="https://healthyml.org">Marzyeh Ghassemi</a>. 
  I am interested in learning robust representations of discrete-valued sequence data, as well as developing methods to characterize and fix their pathologies.
  My research covers questions in language modeling, denoising, and discrete representations, as well as OOD detection, generalization, and fairness.
