  <p id="aboutme">
  I'm a postdoctoral research at NYU working with <a href="https://kyunghyuncho.me">Kyunghyun Cho</a>.
  I completed my PhD at the University of Toronto while visiting at MIT advised by <a href="https://healthyml.org">Marzyeh Ghassemi</a>.

  My general research interest is in developing methods to learn efficient and robust representations of discrete-valued sequence data (specifically natural language). 
  Iâ€™m also interested in understanding and finding ways to fix their pathologies once trained. 
  My research broadly covers topics in representation learning, interpretability, and out-of-domain robustness/generalization.

  Previously I have spent summers interning at <a href="https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design">Prescient Design</a> with <a href="https://kyunghyuncho.me">Kyunghyun Cho</a>, Meta with <a href="https://namangoyal.com">Naman Goyal</a>, and Google with <a href="https://ntvita.com">Narendran Thangarajan</a>.
  I also spent a year working at Facebook AI Research advised by <a href="https://michaelauli.github.io">Michael Auli</a>.
  I completed my undegraduate degree in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Music at UCSD in 2018 advised by <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/">Julian McAuley</a> and <a href="https://www.zacharylipton.com">Zachary Lipton</a>.
