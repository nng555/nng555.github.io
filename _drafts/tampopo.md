I'll be honest, I only heard about this movie because of the Binging with Babish [episode]() where he attempts to recreate the ramen from the movie.
Tampopo is billed as the first "Ramen western" and it holds up to the name. It's a sincere and funny meditation on our relationship to food and the many ways it finds its way into our lives. 
The plot is relatively simple, a truck driver helps a struggling widow (Tampopo) turn her inherited ramen shop into a respectable place to stop for a bowl of noodles.
Interspersed between the scenes of Tampopo lifting heavy pots of water to train her biceps, sneaking through alleyways to secretly watch competing ramen shops make their broth, and jedi mind-tricking a noodle maker to get his recipe, are vignettes of people interacting with food in...interesting ways. 
I'm sure there's some deeper meaning to these scenes that a YouTube film critic has talked about in an hour long video essay but to me they're just plain funny (and also a bit uncomfortable to watch in the case of a certain egg yolk scene).
