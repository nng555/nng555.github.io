*This is part 2 of a blog post on our [**ICML 2024 paper**](). This one goes into the method itself, while [**part 1**](/blog/2024/05/29/mdl.html) goes into the background on the Minimum Description Length Principle
and normalized maximum likelihood. I'd recommend reading that one first before this one unless you're already familiar with MDL.*
